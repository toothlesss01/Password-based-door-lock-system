# Password-based-door-lock-system
A Project that aims to create a simple and effective and pocket friendly security system that grants access to the user upon entry of the right password (Takes in a 4 digit password and compares it to the pre-defined and pre-coded password) . It makes use of the 8051 microcontroller series and is implemented in Keil microvision. 

The entire process can be broken down into 3 subtasks- 
1. The software part- This involves getting our code up and running on the Keil software, debugging errors on the way.
2. Drafting the circuit- By making use of the Proteus software, we come up with a mock circuit that has all our circuit elements like the buzzer, keypad and display screen and interface it with our microcontroller.
3. The Hardware part- After ensuring that our proteus circuit is successfully running, we move on to the hardware and final stage of our project where we solder in all our elements onto our breadboard, make all the necessary connections and interface our led screen and microcontroller to complete our final setup.
